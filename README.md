## Project Description
This repository contains the implementation of a predictive model for heart disease detection, as presented in the associated research paper. The project leverages machine learning algorithms in Python to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in patients. The primary goal is to demonstrate the application of AI in healthcare for early and accurate diagnosis.

## Key features:
- Algorithm: The core model is built using a Random Forest Classifier, chosen for its high accuracy and robustness.
- Data Processing: Handles categorical variables and performs comprehensive data preprocessing, including scaling and correlation analysis.
- Model Evaluation: Achieves an approximate accuracy of 83% on training data, with evaluations conducted using a confusion matrix and other standard metrics.
- Comparative Analysis: Includes implementations and comparisons with other classifiers such as K-Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Technology Stack: Built with standard Python data science libraries including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Workflow
1) Data Collection & Import: Utilizes a dataset containing 14 key medical attributes (e.g., age, cholesterol level, chest pain type, maximum heart rate) from approximately 300 individuals.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performs data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis to understand feature relationships.
3) Model Training & Validation: The dataset is split into training and test sets. The Random Forest model is trained and its performance is validated.
4) Results Interpretation: The model's predictions are interpreted to identify the most significant factors contributing to heart disease risk.

## Results
The Random Forest algorithm provided the best performance among the tested models for this specific dataset, making it a suitable choice for building a reliable heart disease detection system.
